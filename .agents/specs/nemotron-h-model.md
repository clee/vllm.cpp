# Nemotron-H — the first hybrid Mamba2 model, and the first MIXED_PRECISION checkpoint

**Claim:** `CLAIM-MODEL-NEMOTRON-H`. **Model row:**
`MODEL-TEXT-nemotron-h-nemotron-hfor-causal-lm` (existing, stays `INVENTORIED`
at this spec commit). **Issue:** [#517](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/517).

**Hard blocker:** `KERNEL-SSM-MAMBA` [#496](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/496)
([spec](mamba2-ssd.md)). W1 (CPU host references) is in fresh review on
`row/KERNEL-SSM-MAMBA-SSD-W1`; the CUDA arm is W2 of that row. **No forward
path in this spec can be gated before that lands**, and W3 below says so
explicitly rather than pretending otherwise.

**Base:** `main` HEAD `66deca15`.
**Pinned oracle:** `${VLLM_SOURCE}` = `/home/mudler/_git/vllm` @
`5559679229bc961848b121ccdeaa8fa5d79bec98` (vLLM 0.26.0.dev0).
**Driver checkpoint:** `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-NVFP4`
at pinned revision `29f2d1746d8f41e316523194b19018707749b1b1`, staged on the
NAS at `$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-nvfp4` (20.1 GiB, fits one
GB10).

## 0. Scope (headline verdict)

Two things make this arch more than "another model file", and both are the
first of their kind in this tree:

1. **It is the first true hybrid Mamba2 model.** 52 layers: 23 Mamba2, 6 GQA
   attention, 23 MoE. Our GDN hybrids (Qwen3.5, Kimi-Linear) supply the het-KV
   machinery, but not the recurrence — see [mamba2-ssd.md](mamba2-ssd.md).
2. **It is the first `MIXED_PRECISION` checkpoint.** One file carries NVFP4
   W4A16 group-16 experts, FP8 W8A8 static mamba projections, bf16 attention,
   and an fp8 KV scheme. We have never resolved a quant algorithm *per module*;
   `quantization_config` is read ad-hoc in exactly two weight files today
   (`kimi_k3_weights.cpp:171`, `deepseek_v2_weights.cpp:365`).

A third thing is smaller but has no local precedent either: the MoE is
**non-gated**. There is no `gate_proj` anywhere in the checkpoint — the expert
is `up_proj -> relu² -> down_proj`. Every grouped-MoE op we have is
SwiGLU-shaped.

**Out of scope, explicitly:** `NemotronHPuzzleForCausalLM` heterogeneous
per-layer configs (`get_nemotron_h_config_for_layer`), `moe_latent_size`
(null in this checkpoint, so `fc1_latent_proj`/`fc2_latent_proj` are absent),
TP sharding of `n_groups`, ReplaySSM, and any speed claim. Correctness first,
always; no ratio is recorded by this row until the token gate passes.

## 1. The checkpoint, exactly

`architectures: ["NemotronHForCausalLM"]`, `model_type: nemotron_h`,
`hidden_size=2688`, `vocab_size=131072`, `max_position_embeddings=1048576`,
`tie_word_embeddings=false`, weight prefix `backbone.`.

`layers_block_type` (52 entries) gives 23 `mamba`, 23 `moe`, 6 `attention`
at indices **5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 42**.

| Block | Parameters |
|---|---|
| Mamba2 | `mamba_num_heads=64`, `mamba_head_dim=64`, `n_groups=8`, `ssm_state_size=128`, `conv_kernel=4`, `chunk_size=128`, `mamba_hidden_act=silu`, `use_conv_bias=true`, `use_bias=false`, `mamba_proj_bias=false`, `mamba_ssm_cache_dtype=float32`, `time_step_min/max/floor = 1e-3 / 1e-1 / 1e-4` |
| Attention | 32 q / 2 kv heads, `head_dim=128`, `rope_theta=10000`, `partial_rotary_factor=1.0`, `attention_bias=false`, `sliding_window=null` |
| MoE | `n_routed_experts=128`, `num_experts_per_tok=6`, `moe_intermediate_size=1856`, `n_shared_experts=1`, `moe_shared_expert_intermediate_size=3712`, `mlp_hidden_act=relu2`, `norm_topk_prob=true`, `n_group=1`, `topk_group=1`, `routed_scaling_factor=2.5`, `moe_shared_expert_overlap=true` |
| MTP | `num_nextn_predict_layers=1`, `mtp_layers_block_type=["attention","moe"]`, weights `mtp.layers.0.{eh_proj,enorm,hnorm,final_layernorm,norm,mixer.*}`, unquantized |

**Quantization** — `quant_method: modelopt`, `quant_algo: MIXED_PRECISION`,
`producer: modelopt 0.44.0rc5`, two `config_groups` plus a 5981-entry
`quantized_layers` map and an `ignore` list:

| Target | Scheme | Tensors |
|---|---|---|
| routed experts, shared experts, `lm_head` | `W4A16_NVFP4`, **`group_size=16`** | `weight`, `weight_scale` (e4m3 per-16-block), `weight_scale_2` (fp32 global) |
| mamba `in_proj` / `out_proj` (46 targets) | FP8 W8A8 static | `weight`, `weight_scale`, `input_scale` |
| attention `q/k/v/o_proj`, `conv1d`, gates, norms, embeddings | unquantized bf16 | — |
| KV cache | `kv_cache_scheme` fp8 | `k_proj.k_scale`, `v_proj.v_scale` |

Note the polarity trap: the repo name says NVFP4, and most of the *parameters*
are, but the mamba projections are FP8 and the attention tower is bf16. Reading
it as uniform NVFP4 gets the loader wrong in a way a token gate can still pass
while moving the wrong bytes — see [porting.md](../porting.md) on checking the
memory format against the oracle explicitly.

## 2. Upstream chain (`file:line` @ `555967922`)

| What | Anchor |
|---|---|
| registry | `registry.py:179` -> `models/nemotron_h.py::NemotronHForCausalLM` |
| layer dispatch (`ALL_DECODER_LAYER_TYPES`, `M`/`*`/`E`/`-`) | `nemotron_h.py:531-536`, model `:546-600` |
| Mamba2 layer | `nemotron_h.py:373-389` (`MambaMixer2`, fed `mamba_num_heads * mamba_head_dim`) |
| MoE | `nemotron_h.py:126-256` (`NemotronHMoE`), decoder layer `:317` |
| non-gated activation | `activation_without_mul(config.mlp_hidden_act)` -> `ReLUSquaredActivation` (`layers/activation.py`) |
| expert ckpt naming | `ckpt_names=("up_proj", "down_proj", "")` (`nemotron_h.py:220`) |
| routed scale applied to OUTPUT | `apply_routed_scale_to_output=True` (`nemotron_h.py:246`) |
| router dtype | `GateLinear(..., out_dtype=torch.float32, force_fp32_compute=True)` (`nemotron_h.py:150-156`) |
| state shape / dtype | `mamba_utils.py:174-199`, `:73-81` |
| MTP | `models/nemotron_h_mtp.py::NemotronHMTP` (`registry.py:638`) |
| MIXED_PRECISION resolution | `layers/quantization/modelopt.py:2280-2450`, per-layer lookup `:2416-2445` |

The `quantized_layers` lookup is **direct name first, then shard prefix**
(`modelopt.py:2426`, `:2437`). Mirror both, in that order; a merged/sharded
local name that resolves only by prefix is the case that will bite.

Config note: `nemotron_h.py` reads `config.hybrid_override_pattern`, which
newer transformers exposes as a property derived from `layers_block_type`
(`_list_to_pattern`, mapping `mamba->M`, `moe->E`, `attention->*`). Our loader
reads `layers_block_type` directly and does not reconstruct the char pattern.

## 3. Our baseline — reuse vs new

### REUSE (landed)

- Het-KV: `MambaSpec` + `HybridKVCacheCoordinator` + per-group managers
  (porting-inventory.md:78-79,109). Only 6 of 52 layers hold a paged KV group.
- Causal conv1d, all three arms (`kCausalConv1dFwd/Update/SpecUpdate`).
- Grouped-topk sigmoid routing with `e_score_correction_bias` and
  `routed_scaling_factor` — the DeepSeek-V2/V4 path (`kMoeRouterTopK`).
- Shared experts (`kSharedExpertGate`, `kMoeCombineGate`).
- NVFP4 W4A16 grouped MoE Marlin (`kMoeGroupedGemmNvfp4Marlin`), FP8 W8A8
  linear, fp8 KV (`kReshapeAndCacheFp8`).
- MTP spec-decode machinery (`qwen3_5_mtp.cpp`, `SPEC-MTP`).
- Dense attention + rope (`dense_attn::AttnBlock`, `kAttnQkNormRope`).

### NEW

- `vt::Mamba2ChunkScan` / `Mamba2StateUpdate` / `RmsNormGatedGroup` — **owned
  by #496, not by this row.**
- A non-gated `relu²` grouped-MoE arm on the merged-GEMM seam.
- A ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION` per-module quant resolver.
- `nemotron_h.cpp` / `nemotron_h_weights.cpp` / `nemotron_h_registry.cpp`,
  and the MTP head.

## 4. W-breakdown

Each W is one delegated task with its own fresh implementer and fresh reviewer.
W1 and W2 are independent of #496 and can run in parallel with it; W3 onward
cannot.

| W | Content | Gate | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W1** | ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION` resolver: parse `quantization_config`, resolve per-module `quant_algo` (direct then shard-prefix), expose it to weight loading. Refuse an unknown algo by name | unit tests on the REAL `config.json` (committed as a fixture, weights not needed): every one of the 5981 entries resolves, the `ignore` list resolves to unquantized, an unknown algo refuses | — |
| **W2** | Non-gated `relu²` grouped MoE through `MlpGateUpMethodBase` / `vt::MergedGemmGroup`; bf16 arm then NVFP4 W4A16 g16 | byte/tolerance tests vs a host reference; `relu²` mutation caught; routed scale applied to the OUTPUT, not the logits | — |
| **W3** | `nemotron_h_weights.cpp` + `_registry.cpp`: `layers_block_type` dispatch, `backbone.` prefix, het-KV group construction (1 Mamba group + 1 full-attn group over 6 layers), enumeration gate vs the released index | enumeration: every tensor in `model.safetensors.index.json` is claimed or explicitly refused; KV spec shapes match `mamba2_state_shape` | #496 W1 |
| **W4** | `nemotron_h.cpp` forward: hybrid layer loop, Mamba2 mixer wiring, 6 attention layers, MoE layers | CPU forward runs; per-layer activations vs a dumped oracle reference | #496 W1, W2, W3 |
| **W5** | MTP head (`mtp.layers.0`, `eh_proj`/`enorm`/`hnorm`) on the existing spec-decode seam | draft acceptance non-zero; spec-off and spec-on token-identical | W4 |
| **W6** | **GB10 e2e token gate vs the pinned oracle** | token-exact greedy, identical prompts/counts/batching/sampling; oracle identity asserted | #496 W2 (CUDA), W4, W5 |

## 5. Gates

**Correctness first, always.** No throughput number is recorded by this row
until W6 passes. When speed is measured later, the denominator is vLLM's
production configuration, never `--enforce-eager`.

**Oracle identity is asserted, not assumed.** `$HOME/venvs/vllm-oracle` on the
dgx host symlinks to `vllm-oracle-v0.25.0-stage` — vLLM **0.25.0**, transformers
5.13.1 — which predates `NemotronHMoEDecoderLayer` entirely. A run through that
venv fails on this checkpoint and reads as "the model is unsupported". The pin
is `vllm-oracle-next`: `0.23.1rc1.dev1511+g555967922`, transformers 5.14.1,
flashinfer 0.6.15.post1. Every oracle run asserts all three and ABORTS on
mismatch before producing a number.

**The fixture must be the checkpoint the changed path loads.** Pin the
revision (`29f2d174`) explicitly; a repo silently re-quantized under the same
name has cost this project a full campaign before.

**A token gate cannot see a dtype that is too wide.** Every f32 buffer on this
path owes a one-line reason, and the loaded memory format is checked against
the oracle explicitly, not inferred from matching tokens.

**GPU discipline on dgx:** `flock $HOME/gpu.lock`, `local-ai-worker` parked,
never a large oracle alongside `ctest` — `gpu_memory_utilization` reserves HOST
RAM on GB10 and has OOM-rebooted the box.

## 6. Risks / decisions

- **Non-gated MoE must not become a parallel path.** If
  `MlpGateUpMethodBase` / `vt::MergedGemmGroup` cannot represent a
  gate-half-absent expert, extend the seam or record one exact tracked
  exception. Never hand-roll a sibling.
- **`group_size=16` NVFP4.** Confirm our Marlin grouped path actually supports
  16 and does not silently assume another group size. Prove it on the real
  tensors, not on a synthetic fixture.
- **Router in f32.** Upstream forces fp32 router compute
  (`force_fp32_compute=True`). Mirror the polarity; do not inherit the model
  dtype here.
- **`routed_scaling_factor` position.** Applied to the OUTPUT
  (`apply_routed_scale_to_output=True`), not folded into the router weights. A
  mis-placed scale is exactly the class of error a token gate catches late and
  a unit test catches immediately.
- **6 attention layers out of 52** means KV is small and the 1M context is
  cheap — but it also means an attention-side defect is diluted across 46
  non-attention layers and may not move tokens on short prompts. Gate with a
  long-prompt arm, not only a 6-token one.

## 6a. W2 note — the non-gated `relu²` expert, as built

**Seam verdict: the non-gated expert is NOT a merged pair, and does not get a
`MergedGemmGroup` descriptor.** `MergedGemmGroup` describes N GEMMs *sharing
operand A* collapsed into one launch (`merged_gemm.h:1-22`). NemotronH's expert
has exactly one projection — `ckpt_names=("up_proj", "down_proj", "")`
(`nemotron_h.py:220`, the empty third entry being the absent gate) — so with
N == 1 there is nothing to merge and no launch to save; an arity-1 descriptor
would name a fusion that does not exist. `MlpGateUpMethodBase`
(`linear.h:82-86`) is likewise a *merged `[2I,H]` gate_up* seam and has no pair
to hold either.

The arm is therefore the **existing** grouped projection plus the activation we
did not have — exactly the shape the gated bf16 archs had before their pair was
folded (`kMoeGroupedGemmBf16` + `kMoeSiluMul`):

```
up   : kMoeGroupedGemmBf16   (bf16)  |  kMoeGroupedGemmNvfp4Marlin (W4A16 g16)
act  : kMoeRelu2                          <- NEW, the only new kernel
down : kMoeGroupedGemmBf16   (bf16)  |  kMoeGroupedGemmNvfp4Marlin (W4A16 g16)
comb : kMoeCombine(..., routed_scale)     <- routed scale on the OUTPUT
```

No parallel MoE path was added. The reasoning is recorded next to the seam it
excludes (`merged_gemm.h`, the note after the bf16-sibling block).

**`vt::MoeRelu2` (`OpId::kMoeRelu2`, CPU + CUDA).** Mirrors
`ReLUSquaredActivation` (`layers/activation.py:609-628`) as the fused-MoE path
reaches it: `activation_without_mul("relu2")` → `MoEActivation.RELU2_NO_MUL`
(`layers/fused_moe/activation.py:33,98`) → `apply_moe_activation`'s
`F.relu(input, inplace=True); torch.square(input, out=output)`. The **dtype
order is the mirrored part**: upstream's kernel
(`csrc/libtorch_stable/activation_kernels.cu:673-678`) widens to f32, clamps at
zero in f32, squares in f32 and rounds ONCE on the store. No new f32 buffer is
introduced — the op reads and writes the caller's dtype and only its arithmetic
is f32, which is what `LoadF32`/`StoreF32` already are elsewhere in `vt`.

**`routed_scaling_factor` is applied to the OUTPUT**
(`apply_routed_scale_to_output=True`, `nemotron_h.py:234`). `vt::MoeCombine`
gained a trailing `routed_scale` (default `1.0f`, so every landed caller is
byte-identical) which multiplies the routed sum *before* the shared term is
added — literally `moe_runner.py:389-406` (`fused_output *= routed_scaling_factor`,
`shared_output` untouched) followed by `:722-725` (`shared_output + fused_output`).
Upstream forces the ROUTER's factor to `1.0` in exactly this case
(`layer.py:291-300`), so `MoeRouterTopKArgs::routed_scaling_factor` stays 1.0 on
this path. Note this is the *opposite* polarity from Laguna, which folds the same
factor into the router weights by linearity (`laguna_ops.h:48`); NemotronH takes
the literal upstream form.

**`group_size=16` NVFP4 — SUPPORTED, risk closed by source.** `MoeMarlinArgs`
already defaults to `group_size = 16` with `mxfp4 = false` (`ops.h`), and
`cuda_moe_marlin.cu:7,115-129` documents and consumes exactly that
(`group_blocks=1`, `s_type = kFE4M3fn`, `num_groups = size_k / group_size`); 32
is reachable only via the MXFP4 branch. It is the configuration the landed
NVFP4 MoE archs (Laguna, Qwen3.5) already run. A unit test pins the default so a
later widening cannot silently re-point these experts. **Not run here**: this
worktree has no GPU (`nvcc` absent), so the CUDA arms — `kMoeRelu2` on kCUDA,
`kMoeGroupedGemmNvfp4Marlin` on the real g16 tensors — are compiled-and-reviewed
only and remain owed to a GB10 run (W6, or an earlier GPU-host spot check).

**Evidence.** `tests/vt/test_ops_moe_nongated_relu2.cpp` (10 cases): the
activation against hand-computed exact values, the `relu`/`silu` mis-ports, a
bf16-in/f32-out arm that catches narrowing the square, a bf16-out raw-bit arm,
the routed scale on the routed sum only, the 1.0 default being byte-identical to
the landed call, and the whole expert `up → relu² → down → scaled combine` against
an independently-written scalar reference. Mutations executed and caught:
`relu` (5 cases red), `silu` (5 red), square narrowed through bf16 (2 red),
routed scale dropped (2 red), routed scale applied to the combined output
including the shared term (2 red), routed scale folded into the router logits
(3 cases / 498 assertions red in `test_ops_moe_router_grouped`), NVFP4
`group_size` default changed to 32 (1 red).

## 7. Now

**State at this commit:** spec committed, implementation **not started**. The
row stays `INVENTORIED`; this commit changes no lifecycle state. The checkpoint
is staged on the NAS and the oracle smoke run is queued behind the GPU lock.

**Next action:** dispatch fresh implementers for **W1** and **W2** (both
independent of #496) as soon as `row/KERNEL-SSM-MAMBA-SSD-W1` clears review,
so the ops-header churn does not collide.

## 8. Stop conditions

- The pinned oracle cannot be made to load and run this checkpoint on GB10 →
  stop and report; without a running oracle there is no gateable denominator
  and the row does not proceed on source inspection alone.
- A `quantized_layers` entry names an algorithm we do not implement → refuse by
  name and record it as owed. Never silently dequantize to a supported path;
  that is invisible to a token gate.
- The non-gated expert cannot be expressed on the shared merged-GEMM seam →
  `NEEDS_DECISION`, do not fork a parallel MoE path.
